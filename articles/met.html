    <article class="Write__article-box">
        <p class="Write__article-text">Modern malware doesn't appear or wreak havoc the moment it lands on your network. 
            Instead, when establishing a bridgehead, it often implements a series of evasive techniques to avoid being detected 
            by the cybersecurity tools that protect the network.</p>

        <p class="Write__article-text black-text">What are sandboxes and why do malware employ evasive techniques against them?</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">A sandbox is an isolated and controlled virtual environment that’s used for testing and analyzing 
            suspicious inbound files which can potentially be malware before they are allowed into the network. A sandbox mimics systems running in p
            roduction in order to trick malware into executing as they normally would. That way, they can be analyzed without the malware affecting real 
            production environments.</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Because sandboxes are widely known, malware developers now equip their malware with functions/capabilities that enable them 
            to identify that they are in a sandbox so they can evade these virtual environments and trigger only once they have actually entered the network. Typical 
            sandbox evasion techniques include the following:</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text black-text">User interaction detection</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Real production environments are usually characterized by user interaction such as mouse clicks, mouse movements, key strokes, 
            document scrolling, etc. Some sandbox environments emulate user interactions in order to appear to be real production environments. However, some malware 
            are smart enough to distinguish simulated behavior to real user interaction.</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text black-text">Time-based evasion</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Most sandboxes won’t hold a file indefinitely, as doing so may impact productivity if the file in question is part of a business 
            process. Moreover, sandboxes are resource-intensive. Malware aren’t subject to these types of pressure. They can therefore simply stay dormant until the 
            sandbox times out. They can also wait for certain actions to take place, such as a reboot or a login.</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text black-text">Environment evaluation</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Registry, If the registry shows an unusually low number of installed applications, this could be an indication of a sandbox environment.</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Hostname, Some sandboxes use certain hostnames or include certain characters in their hostnames.</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">RAM size, An unrealistically small RAM size (e.g. 1GB) can be indicative of a sandbox.</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Number of CPUs, No-one works on single CPU computers nowadays… except virtual machines.</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Hard disk size, Regular machines usually have hdd sizes over 100gb. An abnormally small disk size would could be indicative of a sandbox.</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Screen resolution, It’s highly unlikely that anyone would work today on a very low screen resolution (e.g., 800×600).</p>
        <p class="Write__article-text">Number of running processes, An unusually low number of running processes can be indicative of a sandbox environment.</p>
